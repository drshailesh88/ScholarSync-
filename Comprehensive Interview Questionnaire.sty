Comprehensive Interview Questionnaire


  - What is the single most important outcome this app should deliver for a student in their first week?
The student should be able to completely write their thesis end-to-end and they should be able to do it within the first 15-20 days of their exposure with the app. End-to-end thesis work should be done by using this app within a couple of weeks.

Usually, it takes a lot of time finding papers, doing synthesis and writing discussions and doing review of literature, everything. I want this app to be able to do all this for the student in the first two weeks only. 
  - What is the #1 thing that must work flawlessly on launch day?
I have already been very lean with the features, and everything that we have included till now should work flawlessly on day one. 
  - What would make you call this “a failure” after 90 days?
If the website works and it is not able to generate decent-quality results for the students and faculty who are using it to write, and I am not able to improve it iteratively in a couple of weeks, and there is the feedback remains like that only for 90 days, I will call it later failure. 
  - What is the “aha moment” you want users to experience?
The aha moment I want the users to experience is the feeling of having a supervising team. Not only a single supervisor but an entire team of supervisors helping you write a thesis. It is the kind of feeling that I want the students to have. Why? Because most of the medical colleges in India do not have these supervisors and guides, they are not very well involved in the thesis, and the students are usually left on the thesis alone. I want the learn mode on this app to give them a feeling that they do not have one supervisor, they have a team of supervisors which can easily replace their guide's job. 

  - Are users strictly 3rd-year MD students in India, or do you want to expand the audience?
This can be used by all the specialties in medicine and all the other specialties of science, but the target audience avatar is the 3rd-year MD student because I have kept one person in mind for which I am making this up, and others are also welcome. We will expand the capabilities for them also, but the ideal audience avatar is 3rd-year MD students. 
  - What is the primary academic output: thesis, review article, dissertation, or journal submission?
I want this app to be able to produce:
	•	Theses
	•	Review articles
	•	Original articles
	•	Dissertations
	•	General submissions
Why? Because most of the competition is able to do this. There are people who do this for you after taking money. There are all types of hacks people are using for getting all the types of articles written. Why should we leave anything on the table? 

  - What are the top 3 user pain points you want to solve?
1. MD students, that is my target avatar has very less time to dedicate to writing thesis and papers.
2.Their guides and supervisors do not give them ample amount of time and do not give them ample amount of guidance on how to write the paper.
3. There are various tools that you have to use and various subscriptions that you have to take to get different parts of your manuscript written.
I want to solve all of these problems. 
  - How much prior research experience do you assume users have?
So, I have made the app in such a way that people who do not have much of the research experience are able to have their work done using my app. People who want the hands-off approach are also able to get their work done. 
  - What is the expected average session length?
For one single paper, I expect that average session length would be 1-2 hours.
	•	If you are writing a chapter for the book, you will be able to write it in 1-2 hours.
	•	If you are writing an original article, then the time might be slightly higher depending on things that you are planning to do.

  - What is a typical “week in the life” for your target user using this app?
A typical week in the life of the target user is spent:
	•	In the hospital entire time
	•	Struggling with patients
	•	Struggling with ward work
	•	Struggling with collecting reports and preparing presentations for the classroom presentation
There is very less time for self-care and self-study, giving time to your thesis.


  - What is the ideal first session flow from signup to value delivered?
Ideal session flow is sign up, trying out the features which are available, and willing to pay money to try out all the features and use it for themselves. 
  - Do you want Learn Mode to be strict coaching only, or allow occasional writing?
We don't have to be very strict with learn mode; the users are already people who have done their graduation. In medicine, this is the ideal target avatar I have in my mind, and it can allow occasional writing. It doesn't mean that it will be agentic writing all the time in all the posts, but learn mode should be ideally strict coaching with allowance for occasional writing. 
  - Should the app allow “shortcut drafting” without Learn Mode for paid users?
If the users are paid, they can have the drafting done and the approach can be as handled or as hands-off as they want. This is how I wanted the draft mode to behave. 

  - Do you want the AI to refuse certain topics (e.g., patient data, sensitive medical content)?
No, because the ideal target avatar is going to deal with patient data and sensitive medical content. 

  - Should the AI ever reference external data beyond papers found in search?
This depends on what database we are already dealing with. If we are already dealing with PubMed very deep and the user is bringing some more papers from his or her own end, we should allow it. 
  - What level of “creative inference” is acceptable in Draft Mode?
  - If the AI returns weak or low-confidence output, what should the UI do?


  - Should search be available to free users, or only paid users?
Yes. This can be a great marketing strategy. People finding papers for their work through us. They discover us and see what all we can bring to the table and we can be useful for their use case, things that they are already doing. 
  - Do you want search results cached and reused across users, or per-user only?
Cachig is important. 
  - What is an acceptable response time for search results?
Les than 1 second 
  - Is paper search a core feature or just support for AI workflows?
Core feature 

  - Should plagiarism checks be anonymous at all, or require login?
plagiarism checks are good methods by which people can discover us and we'll not allow multiple checks, but some can be allowed like one for users without login. Then they can find us, have a look at our website, and use it. 
  - Do you want results shareable via link, or only visible to the owner?
Only visible to owner. 
  - What is the target maximum text length per scan?

  - Should AI detection be a “paid only” feature?
I think we have already zeroed down on this, and there is no point in changing the decision now. Initially, this can be a good tool for people to find us, but then it has to be a paid feature. 

  - Will the Pro plan be launched soon, or should it remain hidden for now?
No, it should not remain hidden for now. 
  - Do you want monthly, yearly, or both billing cycles?
Yes, both billing cycles. 
  - Should users be able to upgrade/downgrade mid-cycle?
Yes, because this is the standard market practice, and I would like to stick to what most of the vendors are doing. 
  - Should usage limits reset monthly, or roll over?
Ideally, it should reset. The thing is, I don't want people gaming the system, so that is the whole reason. 
  - Is INR 1000/month fixed, or should pricing change by region?
For now, this is fixed. 
  Usage Limits & Entitlements

  - Which features must be strictly enforced server-side (non-bypassable)?

  - Should Draft Mode be limited by count, time, or word limit?
I think we should have something like what Scispace is doing. They prevent misuse by giving users tokens per month. This is the practice I see with Genspark and with Manus. We should cap the use of draft mode by something similar. I would not like malpractice. So there are multiple students in a same batch. I would not like one student taking the subscription and sharing with the entire batch, and the entire batch is able to generate their thesis and everything using my app. So I would not like that kind of thing to happen to me. That way I would be paying for the thesis of 10 students, or maybe 30 students, or 25 students. And I'll be burning API tokens and cost of Claude API and other things. There would be maybe only one paying user and covering the needs of 25 people. So I would be net negative in the loss all the time. 
  - Should Learn Mode be limited by session count or time?
In learn mode, also, we should have something similar. It should not be infinite because, at the end of the day, it would be covered by APIs and API costs that I would be paying to Claude, and the users will be burning the tokens that I would be buying. He is getting a fixed subscription at 1000 rupees, and I'm burning tokens infinitely, so that is something that can be catastrophic for me if not checked properly. 
  - Are exports (PDF/DOCX) a paid-only entitlement you want to truly lock down?
Yes. 
  Security & Access Control

  - Should any results ever be accessible without login?
I don't see the point of it. 
  - Should file access be locked to the owning user, always?
Yes. Some people might be writing their papers and it might have sensitive data or they might fear it to be seen by their batch mates or other people writing some other type of papers. They don't want their idea to be stolen, they don't want their data to be stolen, they don't want their content to be seen. So we'll have to respect that. So file access has to be logged to user. 
  - Do you want admin-only access for support/diagnostics?
Yeah, this seems like an important edition. This thing would be important for us. Because I am a team of one, I would be running this with the help of AI agents. What I have in my mind is running it something with Mission Control. See the project by Bhanu P Teja. I was thinking of having something similar to run all this. 
  - Should we introduce secret keys for webhooks to prevent spoofing?
I did not get what you are asking for. Please explain it more. I am not from a DevOps background, nor I am from a technical background, nor I am from a marketing and sales and business background. I want to understand this. This seems to be a very important thing that you are asking here. 
  Reliability & Performance

  - What is an acceptable maximum response time for AI workflows?
  - Is it okay for Draft/Deep Research to run asynchronously and notify later?
Yes, absolutely! 
  - Do you want progress bars or status updates for long jobs?
This seems like a nice design feature to have. Maybe we can have it in V2. 
  - Should we prioritize reliability over speed or cost?
Reliability is absolutely the most important feature that we are going to have because we are dealing with research. If we are giving fake results in a couple of seconds, it means that our business model is doomed. 
  DevOps & Environments

  - Will you use Vercel for production, or another host?
So far, I've thought that I would be using Versal for hosting the front-end and database, and the back-end would go to Convex. This is what I have in my mind. 
  - Do you want separate dev/staging/prod environments?
I'm sorry, I'm not from a DevOps, technical, or business background, so I don't have a fair bit understanding of this Dev staging in broad environments. I would like to be enlightened on this. These seem to be very important concepts about having a Dev environment and a broad environment. I would like to be enlightened on this, and most likely, what my understanding is, you're probably talking about some API keys and other things that I would be using in production. So, if that is what you're pointing towards, it would make sense to have paid API keys in a separate environment. 
  - Who will have access to production secrets?
Only me as of now. I'm a team of one. 
  - Should staging run on every PR?
Again, I'm not a DevOps guy or someone from a technical background, so I would need some enlightenment and hand-holding from your side.

Teaching from your side would be great. What does it mean? From what I understand, it is important, and as far as my understanding is, it should be there on every PR.

But, as I said, I'm not from a technical background. I would love to learn from you on this on what would be best for me and feasible for me. 

  CI/CD & Testing

  - What tests must pass before a deployment is allowed?
What I had in my mind was that AI would be writing as many tests as possible for each feature, each button, and everything. We will take care of all the problems that the AI encounters, and we do proper test-driven development using Ralph Wiggum methodology. 
  - Are E2E tests required on every PR or only before release?
Yes, absolutely! 
  - Do you want a minimum unit test coverage target?
Yes, absolutely! 
  - Are you open to adding contract tests for critical APIs?
Yes. 

  Observability & Analytics

  - Do you want error monitoring (Sentry) from day one?
I think that should be important for us. 
  - What metrics matter most: activation, retention, conversion, feature usage, time-to-first-draft?
Conversion and feet for time to first draft seem to be important features for us. 
  - Do you want session replay tools (LogRocket) or just event tracking?
So, what are these? I would like to be enlightened in these tools and features; they seem important. I would like to have them, and if they are uploaded, there is no point. The philosophy is that I want to be net-positive. If that means investing in tools that can be covered in overall the cost of operations and cost of customer acquisitions and still be a net-positive, we can have tools if they are mandatory and bring things to the table. 
  - What is your acceptable monthly budget for observability tools?
See I want to be net positive in running this operation. This includes the cost of operations and the cost of customer acquisitions. Everything is included. I want to be net positive, and I do understand that observability would be an important tool to have in running something related to this kind of business.

So, I don't have a budget in mind, but I'm open to investing in this. Overall aim is remaining net positive. 
  - Do you want alerting (Slack/email) on errors or failed webhooks?
Yes 

  Data & Privacy

  - What user data should be stored long-term vs. deleted quickly?
I think we aren't storing any important, or very crucial, or critical type of data such as credit cards and their API keys and other things which are sensitive. So we can have it long term. Maybe I'm not sure of this. 
  - How long should documents, scans, and AI outputs be retained?
I would like to be enlightened on this aspect. Whatever standard practice is in the market, whatever other people are doing, will also do this. 
  - Should users be able to delete all data permanently?
Yes. 
  - Do you want data backups and disaster recovery procedures?
Yes. 
  - Do you want to store or mask user inputs in logs?
I am not sure what you ask me in this. This seems something important, but I am not able to understand what this is because I'm not from a business or tech background. So I would like to understand what is this you are asking, and I would like enlightenment on this. 

  Legal & Compliance

  - Do you need a Privacy Policy and Terms before launch?
I don't know this issue and these things. I would like to be enlightened on this aspect. 
  - Are you subject to any local medical data regulations?
Yes, MCI regulates everything. 
  - Should users confirm they are not submitting patient-identifiable data?
Yes, this is important. HIPAA compliance and other similar compliances are going to be very strict in India in coming times, so we have to be sure of this. 
  - Do you want opt-in consent for AI processing of documents?
We can have this. 
  - Will you allow the app to be used for publishing in journals?
Yes, why not? 

  Support & Operations

  - What support channels will exist (email, WhatsApp, chat)?
We'll have support on email and chat in the app that we are building. 
Ai agent followed by me. (Till we dont have enough customers)
  - What is the expected response time for support queries?
Agent responds immediately
I within 24 hrs
  - Do you want an admin panel for manual adjustments (usage resets, refunds)?
Will make a dashboard for this later when the product is ready
  - Will you need a way to audit suspicious usage?
Yes. Absolutely necessary. I don't want people gaming the system and I don't want my microservices gaming me. So any kind of suspicious usage, any kind of suspicious billing, everything has to be identified, tracked, and handled. 
  - Who handles billing disputes or chargebacks?
Ai agent followed by me. (Till we dont have enough customers). I had thought of building something like Mission Control. I would like you to have a look at Mission Control by Bhanu P Teja. I would also consider forking a dashboard. It's called Kiranism on GitHub and make something which would help me control this as a business and run this using AI agents. 
  Go-To-Market

  - What is your launch timeline?
July 2026
  - How many users do you expect in the first month?
100. 
  - Which marketing channel is primary: organic, paid ads, institutional partnerships?
I'm going to be very aggressive as far as the marketing is concerned. None of the marketing channels are going to be secondary channels. Every possible modality that is there in the world, I'll try to hit it. Distribution is going to be the most important thing after building. 
  - What is your conversion target from free to paid?
I want to be the Apple of all the edutech companies. Or Anthropics of all the edutech/ai companies. I would like to have >70% retention because people love the product so much 
  - What is your ideal CAC vs. LTV?
I have not done this math right now, but I would like to be net positive in as far as the customer acquisition cost and operational cost are concerned. I would like to be net positive, and I do not want operational cost and customer acquisition cost to be very high. That is the whole reason I have started this. I have not decided how the LTV will be calculated and how much it would be. I see scope because I see competition is flourishing. 

  Roadmap & Priorities

  - Which of the identified issues should be fixed before launch vs. after launch?
The perfect product should be out in the market why because the competition is already established there are already well-established players. If we have some issues that can cause some security problems or the buttons that they do not work, and if we have a buggy website, it is not going to leave a good taste in the mouth of the users. They'll not stay. We want people who see this app stay and move over from competition like Elicit, Paperpal, Paperpile, Zoetaro, Mendley, Endnote, Scispace, Jenny.ai etc 
  - What are the top 3 new features for the next iteration?
LaTex work making overleaf irrelevant, there is recent integration in which Claude has been integrated into Excel. Now, most of the original articles are written in such a way that people have their Master Charts done. Then they take this Master Chart to people who are doing statistics work on freelance or they're a statistician in the hospital. I want this system to be taken care of by my app itself. They don't have to take a separate Claude subscription. I want to be able to help them with their Excel or their Master Chart with the help of AI. Like in the way Claude has been integrated into Excel. I want to be doing something similar to this that they can upload their Excel and we will handle them how to clean up the Excel sheet. Maybe we'll clean it for them. Then we will guide them on what statistical test to use, and maybe we will use it for them. We will teach them what that test means and how it is applied. Then we'll apply it for students and they will get their data generated. They will get the results written and we will then again handhold them how to write this result for their thesis. How to present it into their dissertation. then we'll apply it for students and they will get their data generated they will get the results written and we will then again hand hold them how to write this result for their thesis how to present it into their dissertation. Then we'll have export in the form of PPT also. People will be able to make their PowerPoint presentation right into this app only. I will be going after Notebook LM also. 
  - Are you willing to delay feature work to harden infra and security?
Obviously, this is a no-brainer. Hardening influence security is important, even if it means more delay. 
  - Which features can be temporarily cut or simplified if needed?
They are already very lean as far as the features are concerned. I previously had some iterations of the same app built, and that one really had many of the features, some of which worked, some of which did not work. This version is already very lean. 
  - What is the next major milestone after V1?
OpenAI had recently come out with a Prism. I want to be taking them down. I want to take people who are in the business of giving softwares like this, like Elicit, Paperpal, Skyspace, and Overleaf, and make them irrelevant.
